# Example-4.3

The Fast Shipping Company manages the distribution of lawnmowers from a company that has two factories (F1 and F2) in the Northeast to two large customer bases (C1 and C2) in the Southwest. For cost and freight consolidation reasons, Fast Shipping would like to route the shipments via three intermediate nodes (T1 â€“ T3) located in the Midwest. The relevant data are provided in Tables 4.2 and 4.3. Set up a model to determine how the shipment is to take place from the two factories to the two destinations via the three intermediate shipment points.
